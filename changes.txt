I ignore requirements, just try running and install missing packages until it works

I comment out the line in app.py that loads APP_SETTINGS environment variable

download postgresql and start it

download pgadmin and create poker_lab_dev database (working on this)

set REDIS_URL environment variable to redis://127.0.0.1:6379/

made "myProcfile" that runs instead of app.py, see readme
